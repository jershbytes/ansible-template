This repository is a minimal, best-practice template for managing Ansible playbooks in a Python virtual environment.


> [!NOTE]  
>Make sure [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) is >installed on your system as this is what i'm using to spin this up.
>It can be easily installed with the command below if not already on the system.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the repo and set up the environment:

cd ansible && bash setup.sh
```

## ✅ When finished, activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```perl
